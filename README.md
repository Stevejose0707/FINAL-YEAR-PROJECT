Advanced approach to lip readingbased text extraction and translation
using a double Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) coupled with Recurrent
Neural Network (RNN) architecture
combining spatial and temporal
feature analysis, this methodology
aims to overcome limitations
identified in prior works, providing
more robust, real-time performance
for diverse applications
